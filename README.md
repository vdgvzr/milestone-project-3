# Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development

# Pen Hub

For this project I have decided to build a book review and recommendation site.

The site will alow users to add, edit or delete details of a particular book and their review of it.
The user will also be able to search for books based on a rating system and to also purchase the book through
an affiliate link. The site owner will then be able to earn money based on each book purchased through the link.

## UX

The primary demographic for the site will of course be book lovers, however there will likely be a very wide and diverse range
of people that would have interest in it. For this reason, I will aim to design the site to be as simple to use as possible,
leaving room for the appropriate information to be displayed as cleanly and easy to read as possible.

The initial design mockup for the site can be found [here](https://github.com/vdgvzr/milestone-project-3/blob/6d93cfebab6a97d90dd757972edd93280d9dea77/assets/mockups/Pen%20Hub%20-%20Initial%20Mockup.pdf).

* Originally the idea was to create the book entry and review simultaneously, however I have decided to keep the book details
and review entries separate to mitigate duplication of book entries. Ideally the, review and rating for the book will appear beneath
the book details so two separate forms will have to be present on the site - one for book entry, and one for review entry for said book.

Because of this, I have identified the main users of the site to be a casual user, and a consumer:

### User Stories

#### Casual Reviewer

As a casual user, I would like to easily add the information for a book and to view, edit and delete my entry.

#### Consumer

As a consumer, I would like to search for book titles and browse by popularity in order to find a book to purchase.
